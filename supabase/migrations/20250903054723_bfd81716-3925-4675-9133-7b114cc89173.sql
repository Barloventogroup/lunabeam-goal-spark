-- Update interview steps with proper scaffolding descriptions
UPDATE steps SET notes = 'Most interviews include these types of questions:

• "Tell me about yourself" - Practice a 2-minute summary highlighting your relevant experience and why you''re interested in this role.

• "Why do you want this job?" - Research the company and role to give specific reasons that show you''ve done your homework.

• "What''s your greatest strength/weakness?" - Choose real examples that demonstrate self-awareness and growth.

Focus on these 3 questions first since they appear in 90% of interviews. Look up the specific company and role to tailor your research.'

UPDATE steps SET notes = 'Write out your answers to 2 of the 3 questions you researched:

• Keep answers to 1-2 minutes when spoken aloud
• Use the STAR method for behavioral questions (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
• Include specific examples from your experience
• Practice writing in a conversational tone, not formal essay style

Example structure for "Tell me about yourself":
1. Current situation (30 seconds)
2. Relevant experience/skills (60 seconds) 
3. Why you''re excited about this opportunity (30 seconds)

Writing them out first helps you organize your thoughts before practicing out loud.'

UPDATE steps SET notes = 'Practice saying one of your written answers out loud:

• Stand in front of a mirror or record yourself on your phone
• Time yourself - aim for 1-2 minutes maximum
• Focus on speaking clearly and at a normal pace (people talk faster when nervous)
• Pay attention to filler words like "um" and "uh"
• Practice maintaining eye contact (with the mirror)

Start with whichever answer feels most natural to you. The goal isn''t perfection - it''s building confidence through repetition. Even 2-3 practice runs will make you feel more prepared.'
