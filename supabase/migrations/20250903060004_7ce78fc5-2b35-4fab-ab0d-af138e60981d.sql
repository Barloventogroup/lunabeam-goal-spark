-- Update interview steps with better formatting and casual, affirming tone
UPDATE steps SET notes = 'Great choice! Most interviews include these core questions that you can absolutely nail with a bit of prep:

    • "Tell me about yourself" - This is your moment to shine! Practice a 2-minute story that highlights your best experiences and shows why you''re excited about this role.

    • "Why do you want this job?" - Show them you''ve done your homework. Research the company and role so you can give specific reasons that demonstrate genuine interest.

    • "What''s your greatest strength/weakness?" - Be authentic here. Choose real examples that show self-awareness and how you''ve grown from challenges.

Focus on these 3 first since they appear in 90% of interviews. You''ve got this! Take a few minutes to look up the specific company and role to make your answers even stronger.'

UPDATE steps SET notes = 'Perfect! Now let''s get those thoughts organized on paper. Writing helps clarify your thinking before you practice out loud.

    • Keep your answers conversational - aim for 1-2 minutes when spoken, not essay length

    • Try the STAR method for any story-based questions: Situation, Task, Action, Result (it''s a simple framework that works really well)

    • Include specific examples from your experience - real stories are much more memorable than generic answers

    • Write like you talk, not like a formal document - this makes practicing easier later

Here''s a simple structure for "Tell me about yourself":
    1. Where you are now (30 seconds)
    2. Your relevant experience and what you''re good at (60 seconds)
    3. Why this opportunity excites you (30 seconds)

Don''t worry about making it perfect - just get your ideas down. You''ll refine them as you practice!'

UPDATE steps SET notes = 'Time to bring those written answers to life! Speaking out loud feels different than reading silently, but that''s exactly why this step is so valuable.

    • Use a mirror or record yourself on your phone - seeing yourself helps with confidence

    • Time yourself and aim for 1-2 minutes max - people tend to speed up when nervous, so practicing at normal pace is key

    • Focus on speaking clearly and naturally - don''t worry about being perfect, just aim for conversational

    • Notice any filler words like "um" and "uh" - awareness is the first step to reducing them

    • Practice maintaining eye contact with the mirror - it builds confidence for the real thing

Start with whichever answer feels most comfortable to you. Even 2-3 practice runs will make a huge difference in how confident you feel. Remember, the goal isn''t perfection - it''s preparation and building your confidence!'
